# chanorth2018-v.1
Process Park focuses on reinserting ourselves into the act of production, to interrupt the paradigm of contemporary alienation.

Our Working Framework is based on the Keleketla! Library's model of community education, an experimental library and collective based in Johannesburg, South Africa: https://keleketla.org/. The Keleketla! Book (58 Years Since the Treason Trial) is meant to be used in different contexts, to process through the meaning of a place, generate a collaborative framework for artists, educators, and creative practitioners, and think through documentation of a collective effort.

“Plans are not made with clear and prescribed end points. Plans are made for the journey, and decisions are made along the way.”    
 	
Framework of Process Park Cycle:                                                                 	           	

<strong>Space for Conversation</strong>\\<strong>Space for Consideration</strong>\\<strong>Space for Implementation</strong>

<li><ul>Conversation: Dinner, Text, Interpretation</ul>
<ul>Consideration: Sleep, Dream, Associate: Verbal Reflection – Written Reflection in the Hackpad – any and all manner of visual, video, and object responses</ul>
  <ul>Implementation: Work/Practice, Techne, Lunch</ul>
  </li>
<p>The Process of Archiving: Archiving, documenting, and writing about the cycles of Conversation, Consideration, and Implementation, will be a key ongoing <em>process!</em> during the residency month. This will consist of our collective work and thinking through texts, our writing in Hackpad during consideration sessions, our conversations and insights generated during site visits, and any and all material deposited into the residency Github. 

The goal is to have, through the Github, a repository of our findings, a way to track our overlaps and intersections as a group, and a method for forking off new strands of inquiry – material, made, or otherwise.

Discussions of the texts will  take place over dinner, after reading together.

Week One, Session 1: John Dewey (36, 37), Having an Experience

Week One, Session 2: de Certeau (29 – 42), Making Do, Uses and Tactics


-Supplemental readings to come from  AGAINST THE DAY (DIARIES), Yann Chateigné.

“After having produced several fragments that I never had the possibility to assemble a form that would satisfy me, from aborted essays to book projects that never happened …”
These will the first of short evocative texts about a series of significant  works and the thinking process behind them. These are meant as generative nodes, jumping off points for reading prose about process-based – practices, and different ways of talking about process—through dreams, images.

-We are also seeking out your own favorite process-based works or practices that you’d like to share with the group and discuss, as well. Instances: Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty, John Cage: Experiments, music that demanded process, like Pauline Olivera, Éliane Radigue, performance and durational art, or work that spans and defies genre, like Genesis Breyer P’orridge, Robert Irwin.

Consideration/Contemplation:

-Hackpad: documentation platform for morning reflections after dinner and text readings:
https://paper.dropbox.com/hackpad/
https://github.com/dropbox/hackpad

We’ll download it together for use. 

-The Hackpad is our Process Park meeting room online: a place to deposit reflections, work through ideas and conversation from the night before, much as one might do with  morning pages.

-Collective writing practice as practiced in Miami during “Recalibrated Institution,” at ArtCenter SF. Share Rail piece.

-Open document / Exquisite Corpse – through writing, developed collective critique and reflection and self-reflection.

-Ultimately, would love to  develop the possibility of making a Zine together – sounds, photographs, papers, letters, ephemera – photos we take along the way. Zine project outline we might use from 58 Years Since the Treason Trial.

-All documentation and process will be placed on Github.

Background of leads: to be placed on website

Nora: I am a writer and critic, acting editor at Rhizome, anchored at New Museum, which focuses on preserving internet-based art and practices, along with commissioning essays and criticism. My background is literary and cultural theory, history, English literature, and then an MFA in fiction, poetry, and non-fiction writing, where I also taught writing. 

My start in writing criticism was as as the first web editor for Kill Screen magazine. I commissioned mostly women to write longform essays and memoir- pieces that were loosely about games, but also, talking about everything but through the medium itself. In m own writing, I worked with the 100+ character artists and landscape and environmental designers to understand the singular process of sound design, simulation and world-building, and rendering of believable characters through 100K+ pages of dialogue. The attraction for me was less reviewing of games or art-games, but instead, the conversations with the artists, the process of building a world, of selecting details to make that world convincing. 

That quickly led to work with and review of, over the next five years, writing on, digital artists, experimental music, and artists working with emerging technology, generally. In , which has a ton of overlap and continuity with the ethics behind experimental practice in music, performance, and sound 


Why I’m here is
What interests me is much of their a lot of their work is hidden and buried
My interest is in documenting the process of the artist – framing it, understanding technique, research, philosophical and larger intellectual interests – and within technology, exploring that  Ritual – prototyping – model making -
Scientific and artistic processes alike share this
Their works flow between technological process, concrete and material artmaking, and
­­­Working across many different fields -tech companies, artist noprofits, musicains, software based artists – who are drawing on a specific ethic of scientific and material research in their own work. I’m also part of the commissioning panel for the Shed – a possible exhibition being unrealized projects that we can have – notes from diaries of artists, sketches, pieces that haven’t been discussed.
A way to work through community is to work through space
Creating connections and relationships for sense-making for a growing community of people
One way to work through that is the space for conversation and dialogue.
